Tired of the endless loot spam while in a Garrison Fishing Party for the turtles or for coins?  This is a simple, lightweight addon that now filters all raid-wide loot spam except for the Frostdeep Minnow, the Riding Turtle, the Sea Turtle, and the Strand Crawler pet.  All else is filtered.

This also keeps track of all the important loot, and if is currently enabled, type /lootspam at any time to get count report on "seen" special items.
